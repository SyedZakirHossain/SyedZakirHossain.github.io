        <h3>Many  people are working on reuse of wastewater.And trying to spread the concept.</h3>
         <h3>Segregation is a must.</h3>
        <h3>Wastewater is any water that’s been used. </h3><h3>That could be by an individual, a business or an industrial process like farming or manufacturing.</h3><h3> However, this can be broken down further, depending on where the water comes from and what’s in it.

</h3><h3>Two types of wastewater</h3><h3>
First of all, wastewater can be broken down into two broad categories </h3><h3> sewage and non-sewage.</h3><h3>

What is sewage?</h3><h3>
Sewage is wastewater that comes from domestic activities.</h3><h3> That includes houses, public toilets, restaurants, schools, hotels and hospitals. </h3><h3>These buildings all produce a lot of wastewater on a daily basis, which generally contains urine and faeces.

</h3><h3>What is non-sewage?</h3><h3>
Non-sewage covers all other types of wastewater.</h3><h3> That includes rainwater and stormwater from flooding, water from commercial activity like garages or laundrettes and water from industrial plants.</h3><h3>Wastewater in your home
In a domestic sense – the kind we’re all most familiar with – </h3><h3> wastewater is split into three categories – black, grey and yellow.</h3><h3>

What is blackwater?</h3><h3>
Blackwater is wastewater that comes from your toilet, kitchen sink and dishwasher.</h3><h3> It contains all the contaminants you would expect from these appliances and fixtures.
           </h3><h3> Faeces, urine and toilet paper, bits of discarded food and plenty of cleaning liquids and chemicals are found in blackwater.</h3><h3>
            As a result, the water is highly contaminated and could potentially cause disease.</h3><h4>

What is greywater?</h4><h3>
In simple terms, greywater is blackwater without urine, faeces or food waste.</h3><h4>
            It comes from baths, bathroom sinks and washing machines (for clothes).</h4><h4>
            While it does contain chemicals and cleaning liquids, it’s much more suitable for re-use because it’s not pathogenic.</h4>
<h3></h3>

        <h4>In a nutshell :   </h4><h3>
Trained camera with Ai , Open CV, Computer vision (python library)  will detect flame and fire .</h3><h3>
 Instantly it send a signal to the microcontroller ,</h3><h3>
and getting the signal from camera  our device will automatically send</h3><h3> alarm, SMS, to fire station, start the water pump and deliver water to the fire . </h3><h3>
        Same functionalities like a household fire and flame  detector. </h3><h3>The only  change is  replace the flame sensor with a long range  trained camera . </h3><h4>
        Mounted on the top of a tower. long range  trained camera will ensure more area coverage.</h3><h3>
How it works :</h4><h3>There are several options.</h3><h4>

Option one:-</h4><h3> Mount the  camera on a tower  or we set a network of small cameras inside the bushes.</h3>
<h3> As the camera detect flame or fire it will send signal to us.</h3><h3>
        
        And we will send the signal to nearest fire station. In exchange we get a service charge from the government.</h3><h4>
Option two:-</h4><h3>Lets upgrade the forest fire protection department. Set up camera throughout the forest .</h3><h3>
        Set up a unit combined with  a deep tube well , a pump house, with staff residential cabin, with water dispensing vehicle ,</h3><h3>
        this unit can cover the area within  30 kilometer radius. After every 50 KM one unit set up will be installed. </h3><h3>
24h/365 d monitor with trained person with trained camera. </h3><h3>Fire department will build all infrastructures. We only provide technical support. </h3><h3>
        In exchange of a certain revenue, which must be value driven .</h3><h3> We can re use same python code with thousands of cameras. </h3><h3>
        But when we claim total bill, we count the total no of cameras each camera with fixed  rate .</h3><h3>
        As this is a business model that’s why we are discussing it. </h3><h4>
Option three:-</h4><h3> We can provide all support ,from tower installation and camera set up to pump house automation .</h3><h3>
        Field staff recruit ,training, as a package. </h3><h4>
   As a pilot project we will cover 10*10 =100 sq km areas under one pump house and camera surveillance unit. </h4><h3>
        After observing the result of  the trial  with demo fire set up. We will get the result instantly. </h3><h3>
        Then like copy and pest we spread the units throughout the whole forest.</h3><h3>

     <h4>There are many complexities behind everything in the world that are not always understood.
We should never just look at the surface, it is quite foolish to judge another without understanding.

Those who always want to pay the food bill themselves do not mean that their money is overflowing. This is because to him friendship has greater value than money.
Those who work in the first place, it means that he is not a fool, in fact he has a sense of responsibility.
Those who apologize first after a quarrel or argument are not mistaken, but rather they evaluate the people around them.
The one who wants to help you and does not expect anything from you,  he is a real friend.
Just because someone texts you often doesn't mean they have no work, they actually love you with all their heart.

    <h2>Love to share some inspiring quotes from "The Wings Of Fire" the autobiography of A P J Abul Kalam. Ex president of India. </h2>
      
        <h3> </h3>
        <h3>If you fail, never give up because FAIL means "First Attempt In Learning". </h3>
     <h2> To succeed in your mission, you must have single-minded devotion to your goal.</h2>
     <h3>Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action.</h4>
     
     <h2> Don’t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck. </h2> 
     
     <h3>He who knows others is learned, but the wise one is the one who
knows himself. Learning without wisdom is of no use.</h4>
    
    
     <h2>Don’t worry and fret, fainthearted,
The chances have just begun,
For the best jobs haven’t been started,
The best work hasn’t been done.</h2>
     <h3>If you want to leave your footprints
On the sands of time
Do not drag your feet.</h3>
 
       <h2>For all your days prepare
And meet them ever alike
When you are the anvil, bear –
When you are the hammer, strike.</h2>
     <h3>The best performances are accomplished when you are relaxed and
free of doubt. Take things as they came. </h3>
    
     <h4>Does the seagull not fly across the Sun, alone and without a
nest? You must forego your longing for the land of your memories to
move into the dwelling place of your greater desires; our love will not
bind you nor will our needs hold you.</h4>
<h4>Your children are not your children.
    They are the sons
and daughters of Life’s longing for itself. They come through you but
not from you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts. For

they have their own thoughts.</h4>
     <h4>“This land may be housing your body
but not your soul. Your soul dwells in the house of tomorrow which none
of us at this country can visit, not even in our dreams. May God bless
you, my child!”</h4>
     
     <h3> To succeed in life and achieve results, you must
understand and master three mighty forces— desire, belief, and
expectation.</h3>
     <h1>With faith, you can change your destiny</h1>
     
     
     <h3>Desire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when it is pure and
intense, possesses awesome electromagnetic energy. This energy is
released into the ether each night, as the mind falls into the sleep state.
Each morning it returns to the conscious state reinforced with the cosmic
currents. That which has been imaged will surely and certainly be
manifested. You can rely, young man, upon this ageless promise as surely as 
you can rely upon the eternally unbroken promise of sunrise... and of
Spring.</h3>

<h2>When the student is ready, the teacher will appear—How true! Here
was the teacher to show the way to a student who had nearly gone
astray! “Accept your destiny and go ahead with your life. You are not
destined to become a Pilot. What you are destined to become
is not revealed now but it is predetermined. Forget this failure, as it was
essential to lead you to your destined path. Search, instead, for the true
purpose of your existence. Become one with yourself, my son! Surrender
yourself to the wish of God</h2>
     <h3>I knew I had to create my own opportunities.</h3>
